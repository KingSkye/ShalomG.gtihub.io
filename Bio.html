<h1>Welcome to my personal website</h1>
<h2>About Me:</h2>

<div class="a"><p>My name is Shalom Gomez I grew up in Pleasentville where I currently live. I attended Coffe Boys Anglican School
and graduated for Pleasentville Secondary School. Over the many years of attending school. I graduated my secondary school with four (4) subjects.
I turned 18 on the 28th of Febuary I am still currently living with my parents. Upon graduating Secondary School I decided the best course of action would be to move on to sign up for College more specifically COSTAATT which I am currently 
attending. I did not do A levels as I saw it wasnt needed and I didnt feel like putting the time it would take to finish it. I am currently doing my bachelors in Computer System Informations. I intend on doing Software Porgramming as my main career choice.</div></p>
