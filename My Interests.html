<div class="a"><p>I have many interests but the most
 prevalent would be my enthusiasm for the automotive industry and overall car enthusiams.
 This includes motorsports such as GT and F1 racing which I follow very closely on social mediia.</p>

 <p>Another strong interest of mine is the Tech industry i've proceeded to do IT courses
 during my time in COSTAATT because my fasination with Technology and how it can always keep evolving has pushed me to learn more about it.
 </p>
 <p>I love computers and big part of that has to do with gaming. I regulary game it's one of my best past times when i got nothing to do.
 It's fun relaxing and really great with friends.</p>
 <p>I love knowing about computers mainly how to build them. The feeling of building a worker PC on your own from scratch and have it working 100% is a great feeling.
 Ofcourse building a PC first time can be tricky and there is no real way you would get it rigth the first time but overtime you begin to understand more and more and become more skilled on the subject.
 The end result is a fast PC you built from the parts you ordered from scratch.</p>
 <p>As one of my major acomplishments I would like to have a great setup both for gaming and max work productivity.</p>
